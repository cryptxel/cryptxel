### Hi 👋

## I'm a Senior Full Stack developer

I've been a web engineer for about 10 years. I specialize in frontend and backend development. Currently I work on Deno 🌧🦕.

I use mainly PHP, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, C#, and Ruby on Rails for my job, and sometimes I use Rust, Golang, Java, etc depending on the situations. I've published ~100 packages to npm.

I've been learning Rust 🦀, Go, and OCaml 🐪 recently.
